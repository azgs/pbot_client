# User-entry fields for Person Nodes + Registration Information

## Structure of the info in this doc:
Because thinking through Person Nodes also required us to think through User Registration information, this document includes sections for each of these. Person Nodes include both users and authors, so the amount of information to create a person node will be minimal (remember, long deceased authors). More information will be required for user registration, though. When a user registers, a person node will automatically be created, or updated. 

Fields are divided into **Required Fields**, which users must enter when they create the node, **Recommended Fields**, which are encouraged to be entered on node creation but not required (note, none exist for Groups), and **Fields that will be autogenerated by PBot**, which should be viewable by users. For each field, we have compiled the information and structured as follows:
 
### Name of field for user interface 
* PBot: the PBot backend field name+code from the list Claire generated. Many will be missing.
* dwc: the DarwinCore field term name and link to term info. https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/ 
* Info: the definition of the field. In addition to being for our internal use, these will serve as the draft for later definitions used in the guidelines/tutorials for users. 
* Entry type: describe how users will enter data into the field
* Considerations: this is an optional section, if there is info to convey to the PBot team (Botany, Dev, or both) about the field. Notes, wishes, questions, etc. 

## Since we have so few fields, there will be no accordions. We've decided that required fields should be noted to the users by * next to the field name.

# Person Nodes 
### Given name*
* Entry type: free text, required field
* Considerations: Encourage middle initials to be able to easily differentiate among people? Do we need to worry about this? Do we need middle initials to be able to properly enter references?
* PBot: given: [given]
* dwc:
* Info: Given name of the person. If the given name is unknown, you may enter an initial only.
 
### Surname
* PBot: surname: [surname]
* dwc:
* Info: Surname of the person.
* Entry type: free text
* Considerations: We need to make sure that duplicate entries are not being created. Important for inclusivity to accommodate accent marks and basic non-English characters (examples: ä  æ  ç   ñ). We need to provide instructions on whether extra parts of a name (e.g. III, Jr.) also get included here.
 
 
## Optional fields:
### Middle name / Middle initial
* PBot: 
* dwc:
* Info: Middle name or initial of the person
* Entry type: free text
* Considerations: Not everyone has a middle name, so must be optional. But, obviously will be wanted for references.

### Email address
* PBot: email: [email]
* dwc:
* Info: Email address of the person.
* Entry type: free text
* Considerations: are all email addresses publicly accessible?
 
### ORCID
* PBot: orcid: [orcid]
* dwc: relevant entries: http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/identifiedByID and http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/recordedByID
* Info: ORCID of the person, which should be in the format ####-####-####-####
* Entry type: free text
* Considerations: probably beyond our means, but might it be possible to validate the ORCID?

### Group memberships
* PBot: memberOf: [Group!]! @relation(name: "MEMBER_OF", direction: OUT)
* dwc: 
* Info: Shows what Groups a person belongs to. Obviously everyone is in the Public.
* Entry type: drop-down menu of group nodes
* Considerations: I believe we landed on that some groups can be private. So, only the information displayed to a user would reflect accordingly.

## Fields auto-generated by PBot:
 
### pbotID
* PBot: pbotID: ID!
* dwc:  
* Info: Internal unique identifier in the PBot database. 
* Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot when creating a new record.
 
### Entered by
* PBot: enteredBy: [PersonEnteredBy]
* dwc: similar to but not quite synonymous with recordedBy http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/recordedBy
* Info: The user who entered the record.
* Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot based on the user login when creating a new record.

### Date entered 
* PBot: 
* dwc:
* Info: Date the person node was entered
* Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot when creating a new record.

### When person joined PBot
* PBot:
* dwc: 
* Info: 
* Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot based on the user registration date.
* Considerations: I'm not sure that it is necessary to see when a person node was created, although this would I think be very easy to collect. But, I think it is important to see which of our Person Nodes are also users and when they joined. Useful database tracking and assessment information.
 
# User-entry fields for User Registration

## Required fields:
 
### Surname
* PBot: surname: [surname]
* dwc:
* Info: Your surname
* Entry type: free text
* Considerations: We need to make sure that duplicate entries are not being created. Important for inclusivity to accommodate accent marks and basic non-English characters (examples: ä  æ  ç   ñ). We need to provide instructions on whether extra parts of a name (e.g. III, Jr.) also get included here.
 
### Given name
* PBot: given: [given]
* dwc:
* Info: Your given name
* Entry type: free text
* Considerations:

### Email address
* PBot: email: [email]
* dwc:
* Info: Your current email address
* Entry type: free text
* Considerations: are all email addresses publicly accessible?

### Why do you want a PBot account?
* PBot: 
* dwc:
* Info: To make sure that we are not being hijacked by bots or trolls, we should have a very basic question about why people want access. This will then need to be approved by the PBot ExCom.
* Entry type: free text
* Considerations: How does this get set up to either send an email to ExCom for approval?
 
## Recommended fields:
  
### ORCID
* PBot: orcid: [orcid]
* dwc: relevant entries: http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/identifiedByID and http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/recordedByID
* Info: Your ORCID, which should be in the format ####-####-####-####
* Entry type: free text
* Considerations: probably beyond our means, but might it be possible to validate the ORCID? This needs to be kept optional (but strongly encouraged) since the amateur community is not like to have an ORCID.

### Middle name / Middle initial
* PBot: 
* dwc:
* Info: Your middle name or initial
* Entry type: free text
* Considerations: Some people feel strongly about this, so we can have it but be optional

### Short biography
* PBot: 
* dwc:
* Info: Introduce yourself to the community with a short (less than three sentence) bio. Suggested content: Career stage, affiliation, paleobotanical interests & expertise
* Entry type: free text
* Considerations: 
 
## Fields auto-generated by PBot:
 
### pbotID
* PBot: pbotID: ID!
* dwc:  
* Info: Internal unique identifier in the PBot database. 
* Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot when creating a new record.

### Entered by
* PBot: enteredBy: [PersonEnteredBy]
* dwc: similar to but not quite synonymous with recordedBy http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/recordedBy
* Info: The user who entered the record.
* Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot based on the user login when creating a new record. This is only relevant if creating a login can also automatically create a person node.

### When person joined PBot
* PBot:
* dwc: 
* Info: 
* Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot based on the user registration date.


## Additional Discussions about Person-Group Relationships:
* Dori: I think group membership is only handled through the group nodes - people can't self-select themselves to existing groups post-registration. You can create a group that includes yourself, or someone in an existing group can add you to that group through their project functions,
* Claire: Groups have a relationship to a person so when this is updated is a good question. For example, will a workbench page that lists groups refresh and pull all group relationships every time it is opened? Do we need to include a refresh button to all workbench pages that refreshes all relationships associated with that page?
