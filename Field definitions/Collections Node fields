# User-entry fields for Collection Nodes

Structure of the info in this doc: Fields are divided into **Required Fields**, which users must enter when they create the node, **Recommended Fields**, which are encouraged to be entered on node creation but not required, and **Fields that will be autogenerated by PBot**, which should be viewable by users. For each field, we have compiled the information and structured as follows:
 
### Name of field for user interface: 
* PBot: the PBot backend field name+code from the list Claire generated. Many will be missing.
* dwc: the DarwinCore field term name and link to term info. https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/ 
* Info: the definition of the field. In addition to being for our internal use, these will serve as the draft for later definitions used in the guidelines/tutorials for users. 
* Entry type: describe how users will enter data into the field
* Considerations: this is an optional section, if there is info to convey to the PBot team (Botany, Dev, or both) about the field. Notes, wishes, questions, etc. 

## Required fields:
###Collection name:
* PBot: name: [name]
* dwc: http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/collectionID?,http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/datasetName?
* Info: A unique identification that may also aid in recognizing close links among collections. For example, if you are entering multiple collections from the same collection (e.g., a series of consecutive beds), use collection names that reflect their relationship (e.g., "Bully Hill 1.5 meter bed" and "Bully Hill 2.0 meter bed"). Keep the name short and do not enter a string of terms such as "XX Quarry, XX Formation, XX County, XX Country, XX km south of such-and-such." All of this information except "XX Quarry" should go in other fields.
* Entry type: free text, limit of 80 characters
* Considerations: need to have a check to make sure the name is unique, and also will need to integrate with PBDB to make sure names are unique. If the collection is already in PBDB, we will want to pull the data from there so that the user does not enter and potentially make errors. Andrew has a plan for how to do this all.

### Reference:
* PBot: [CollectionCitedBy] : creates relationship to one or more reference nodes
* dwc: associatedReferences http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/associatedReferences
* Info: Provide information for one or more references that described the collection (locality). This may also be a temporary holder for personal workbenches and unpublished collections.
* Entry type: search by [title? author?] and then select.
* Considerations: allow multiple references to be linked to each collection.

### Data access group(s): 
* PBot: elementOf: [Group!]! @relation(name: "ELEMENT_OF", direction: OUT). Creates a relationship with PBot groups.
dwc: not relevant. This is PBot internal relating to who can access these records.
Info: Defines who has access to view and edit the record.
Entry type: multi-select from the users groups (i.e. projects) and the option Public
Considerations: This is for internal PBot use only. Does not need to pipe to PBDB. 

### Country:
*PBot:
* dwc:
* Info: 
* Entry type: dropdown menu with all the countries in the world as options (PBDB has this- easy to find?)
* Considerations: required for PBDB. If we have the capability to auto-fill once lat-long are entered, that would be great, but maybe hard. From Mark: Asking for both country and state along with lat/long is a good error checking routine. PBDB roughly checks to see if your coordinate are in the right country (maybe not state...), which helps with typos.

### Latitude:
* PBot:
* dwc: decimalLatitude http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/decimalLatitude
* Info: From PBDB: Record the present-day latitude and longitude (as opposed to paleolatitude and paleolongitude, which are not currently included in this database). "Degrees" must be filled out if anything on these two lines is. Enter minutes and seconds if these are given in the original source; if decimal values are given instead (e.g., "37.823"), enter the part before the decimal point in "Degrees" (e.g., "37") and the part after the decimal point in "Decimal value" (e.g., "823"). Do not fill in both the minutes fields and the decimal field. So if you have data like "37 degrees 21.57 minutes," convert the ".57" part into seconds (in this case, 34.2 seconds). Note that you can put decimal values in the seconds field, just not in the minutes field. More info in PBDB resources. Also, we will want to include rules about what GPS coordinates to enter if you only have county, state, or country information.
* Entry type: free text, numeric
* Considerations: Degrees and Direction are required by PBDB, and PBDB gives boxes to free-text enter Degrees, Minutes, Seconds, and Decimal, with a drop-down menu for direction (for latitude, options are North or South). Would we like to duplicate this, or just require everyone to do decimal degrees? If we have everyone enter decimal degrees, then can we have a single entry field and PBot will split it apart when it is piped to PBDB. PBDB allows you to choose the datum- do we want to do that or ask everyone to use the same datum?

### Longitude
* PBot:
* dwc:decimalLongitude http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/decimalLongitude
* Info: The geographic longitude (in decimal degrees, using the WGS84 datum) of the geographic center of a collection. Positive values are east of the Greenwich Meridian, negative values are west of it. Legal values lie between -180 and 180, inclusive. See also Latitude field for PBDB issues.
* Entry type: free text, numeric
* Considerations: Degrees and Direction are required by PBDB, and PBDB gives boxes to free-text enter Degrees, Minutes, Seconds, and Decimal, with a drop-down menu for direction (for longitude, options are East or West). Would we like to duplicate this, or just require everyone to do decimal degrees? If we have everyone enter decimal degrees, then can we have a single entry field and PBot will split it apart when it is piped to PBDB. PBDB allows you to choose the datum- do we want to do that or ask everyone to use the same datum?

### GPS coordinate uncertainty:
* PBot:
* dwc: http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/coordinateUncertaintyInMeters
* Info: provide a radius of uncertainty (in meters) for the GPS coordinate entered
* Entry type: numeric
* Considerations: this is not required for PBDB, and in fact doesn't even fit any of their fields. Mark would like to change to this, but PBDB doesn't have the ability to do that right now. He said: "This is NOT a required field for PBDB so maybe you guys do point/radius and we can work towards that in our system."

### Authorâ€™s main reason for describing collection:
* PBot:
* dwc:
* Info: Characterize the intent or subject area of the part of the publication from which the collection was compiled. Be careful because different parts of one paper might have different purposes. When in doubt, use the category that best describes the whole paper.
biostratigraphic means described for the purpose of temporal correlation, or in the course of a geological study (e.g., lists given within descriptions of measured sections). When in doubt, choose general faunal/floral.
paleoecologic means described for the purpose of paleoecological analysis, including taxonomic lists that are given without descriptions of fossils and without discussions of temporal correlation.
taphonomic means described for the purpose of a taphonomic analysis.
taxonomic means a systematic paleontology treatment, including simple descriptions of fossils. Use this if the all the taxa are included in a systematic paleontology section, or if the taxonomic list is given only in support of an otherwise taxonomic account of one or a few taxa.
general faunal/floral means there is no detailed discussion of the age, environment, ecology, preservation, or morphology of the fossils, but a taxonomic list is given. Use this category only if the other ones are too specific.
* Entry type: drop-down menu or check-box. options are: biostratigraphic, paleoecologic, taphonomic, taxonomic, general fanual/floral.
* Considerations: This is a required field for PBDB, so we must also make it required.

### Maximum time interval:
* PBot:
* dwc: has options for Eonothem, Erathem, Period/System, Epoch/Series, Age/Stage. E.g., http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/earliestPeriodOrLowestSystem
* Info: Enter the zone, age/stage, epoch, or period from which your collection is drawn. Use the most precise term you can. Geographically localized terms like "Wasatchian" and "Richmondian" are fine. If the time interval's name starts with "Late," "Upper," "Middle," etc., use the pull-down menu to select the proper term. Do not type these terms into the input field. Note that the "Early/Middle/Late" pull-down menu is not required. If the age of the collection spans more than one interval, put the oldest (= maximum) time interval in the first input field and the youngest in the second. Example: the collection is "Late Triassic to Early Jurassic." Put "Triassic" at the left and "Jurassic" at the right, with the left and right pull-downs set to "Late/Upper" and "Early/Lower," respectively. If a collection is known to span, or could span, multiple intervals, ignore the ones in between. So, if the span is as the Givetian, Frasnian, and Fammenian stages, then the maximum is "Givetian" and the minimum is "Fammenian." If the maximum and minimum values are identical, only the first field needs to be filled in. Do not put words like "epoch," "series," "age," or "stage" in these fields! 
* Entry type: free text to fixed selections (will need to have a LOT of options)
* Considerations: I think there is a lot going on the back-end with PBDB to match higher resolution intervals with lower resolution Periods, etc. Do we want to do that as well, or have it more specified?

### Protected site?
* PBot:
* dwc:
* Info: is this considered a legally protected site?
* Entry type: Yes / No
* Considerations: Andrew included this field: "Protected -- Boolean". PBDB does not require it to be entered. Mark says: "This has been hacked in by Shanan."

##Recommended fields:
###Paleobiology Database Link 
* PBot:
* dwc:
* Info: Link to an equivalent PBDB collection
* Entry: free text
* Considerations:

### State/province:
* PBot:
* dwc: 
* Info: A required field if the country is the USA. Elsewhere, its use is also encouraged (e. g., England is a "state" of the United Kingdom, Ontario is a province of Canada). You must spell out the entire state name; do not use U.S. postal codes like "CA" or "WY."
* Enty type: free text
Considerations: This a required field for PBDB if the country is USA. If we have the capability to auto-fill once lat-long are entered, that would be great, but maybe hard. From Mark: Asking for both country and state along with lat/long is a good error checking routine. PBDB roughly checks to see if your coordinate are in the right country (maybe not state...), which helps with typos.

### Scale of geographic resolution:
* PBot:
* dwc:
* Info: From the pop-up menu, select the resolution that best characterizes your collection. Err on the side of conservatism: if you know the collection is from a particular road cut but don't know if it does or doesn't come from a small excavation within the road cut, enter "outcrop" instead of "small collection." If no information is given, do not make a selection. Terms are defined as follows:
small collection: from an area < 10 x 10 m, e.g., a single fossil, an individual bulk sample, or a small quarry
outcrop: from an area < 1 x 1 km, e.g., a large quarry, road cut, or wash
local area: from an area < 100 x 100 km, e.g., approximately a one-by-one degree lat/long rectangle or the size of most individual counties in the USA
basin: from any area > 100 x 100 km
* Entry type: drop-down menu, select one, with choices: hand sample, small collection, outcrop, local area, and basin
* Considerations:

### Minimum time interval
* PBot:
* dwc: has options for Eonothem, Erathem, Period/System, Epoch/Series, Age/Stage. E.g., http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/earliestPeriodOrHighestSystem
* Info: See PBDB text under Maximum Time Interval. They discuss both together.
* Entry type: free text to fixed selections (will need to have a LOT of options)
* Considerations: This is not required because PBDB has you only enter Maximum time interval if the collection falls entirely within one time interval.

### Direct date and method
* PBot:
* dwc:
* Info: Numeric age if associated with specific geochron measurement.
* Entry: PBDB has a box for date, a Plus/minus error box, and then drop-down for Ma, Ka, or YBP. Big list of methods, including Ar/Ar, astronomical, 14C, 14C (calibrated), dendrochronology, ESR, fission track, K-Ar, Lu-Hf, paleomagnetic, Rb-Sr, Sr isotope, U/Pb, U/Th, age-depth, AEO, CONOP, graphic correlation, RASC, seriation, UA, other, unknown.
* Considerations: Should we reduce the PBDB options, especially given that we have the "other" option. I think Sr isotopes are mostly used in marine records, for instance.

### Numeric maximum age: 
* PBot:
* dwc:
* Info: Age in Myrs if associated with specific geochron measurement. These should not be filled in if a collection can only be assigned to a Period, Epoch, Age, or Series.
* Entry: PBDB has a box for date, a Plus/minus error box, and then drop-down for Ma, Ka, or YBP. Big list of methods, including Ar/Ar, astronomical, 14C, 14C (calibrated), dendrochronology, ESR, fission track, K-Ar, Lu-Hf, paleomagnetic, Rb-Sr, Sr isotope, U/Pb, U/Th, age-depth, AEO, CONOP, graphic correlation, RASC, seriation, UA, other, unknown.
* Considerations: PBDB has Max date and method. Has a box for date, a Plus/minus error box, and then drop-down for Ma, Ka, or YBP. Big list of methods.

### Numeric minimum age:
* PBot:
* dwc:
* Info: Minimum numeric age if associated with specific geochron measurement. These should not be filled in if a collection can only be assigned to a Period, Epoch, Age, or Series.
* Entry: PBDB has a box for date, a Plus/minus error box, and then drop-down for Ma, Ka, or YBP. Big list of methods, including Ar/Ar, astronomical, 14C, 14C (calibrated), dendrochronology, ESR, fission track, K-Ar, Lu-Hf, paleomagnetic, Rb-Sr, Sr isotope, U/Pb, U/Th, age-depth, AEO, CONOP, graphic correlation, RASC, seriation, UA, other, unknown.
* Considerations: PBDB has Max date and method. Has a box for date, a Plus/minus error box, and then drop-down for Ma, Ka, or YBP. Big list of methods.
