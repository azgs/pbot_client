User-entry fields for each form and relevant info
(*here, a form is conceptualized as all the fields for one “submit” - probably corresponds to a node)

Structure of the info in this doc: 

Name of field for user interface (It would be good if the word schema does not need to be repeated all the time on the schema page for crispness and space saving reasons): 
PBot: the PBot backend field name+code from the list Claire generated
dwc: the DarwinCore field term name and link to term info. https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/ 
Info: the definition of the field. In addition to being for our internal use, these will serve as the draft for later definitions used in the guidelines/tutorials for users. 
Entry type: describe how users will enter data into the field
Considerations: this is an optional section, if there is info to convey to the PBot team (Botany, Dev, or both) about the field. Notes, wishes, questions, etc. 

*I grouped fields by required, optional, and links to outside sources, as I found that helpful for considering the fields.

Schema Node with Considerations of Workbench and Search Functions

Schema Nodes

Entry Fields:
* means required

Title*: 
Entry type: string. Required
PBot: Schema:title
Dwc:NA
Info: The title should be the same as the published or working title and therefore should match the reference title 
Considerations: 

Reference*: 
Entry type: search and populate ref. Required.
PBot: Reference:citedBy: [Citer!]! @relation(name: “CITED_BY”, direction:OUT)
dwc: provided in reference node fields
Info: This is the published schema citation or working citation if schema still  in development 
Considerations: We are assuming that those who created the schema are on the reference and those who entered the schema if different are in the acknoledgements

Acknowledgements: 
Entry type: string
PBot: Schema:acknowledgements
Dwc: NA
Info: A space for schema authors to acknowledge researchers, artists, etc. who contributed to development of the schema. Credit users that enter schema PBot.
