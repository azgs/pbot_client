# User-entry fields for Reference Nodes

Structure of the info in this doc: Fields are divided into **Required Fields**, which users must enter when they create the node, **Recommended Fields**, which are encouraged to be entered on node creation but not required, and **Fields that will be autogenerated by PBot**, which should be viewable by users. For each field, we have compiled the information and structured as follows:
 
### Name of field for user interface: 
* PBot: the PBot backend field name+code from the list Claire generated. Many will be missing.
* dwc: the DarwinCore field term name and link to term info. https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/ 
* Info: the definition of the field. In addition to being for our internal use, these will serve as the draft for later definitions used in the guidelines/tutorials for users. 
* Entry type: describe how users will enter data into the field
* Considerations: this is an optional section, if there is info to convey to the PBot team (Botany, Dev, or both) about the field. Notes, wishes, questions, etc. 

## Required fields:

### Reference title: 
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: 
* Info: The source (article/book chapter/ book if the entirety is being referenced as opposed to a chapter in a book) title. PBDB Tips: Type in the entire title and do not use abbreviations. Use of colons and semi-colons is OK. If the title is not in English, enter the original title first, and then enter an English-language translation in brackets. For a thesis, enter only the name of the institution (e.g., “University of Saskatchewan”)
* Entry type: string
* Considerations: 

### Publication year: 
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: 
* Info: PBDB Tips: This is a required field. Use that actual date of publication, if available, not the nominal year of publication for the volume.
* Entry type: Four digit numeric entry
* Considerations: 

### First author: 
* PBot: 
* dwc: 
* Info: 
* Entry type: select person node- possible to start typing and then have auto-fill-in? Needs to be an easy way to accommodate adding a new person node if there is not already one created.
* Considerations: Note that we would want to have an "Anonymous person node"

### First page number: 
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: 
* Info: PBDB Tips: This is a required field. Do NOT add a hyphen after the page number: this will be done automatically by the data entry processing program. If you are citing an entire book, put “1” here and the total number of pages in the last page field. If the pages are numbered with combinations of numbers and letters (e.g., “A-32) put everything in and do not strip the letters.
* Entry type: string
* Considerations: 

### Last page number: 
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: 
* Info: PBDB Tips: This is a required field. Do NOT add a hyphen before the page number: this will be done automatically by the data entry processing program. If you are citing an entire book, put “1” in the first page field and the total number of pages here. If the pages are numbered with combinations of numbers and letters (e.g., “A-32) put everything in and do not strip the letters.
* Entry type: string
* Considerations: 

### DOI: 
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: 
* Info: 
* Entry type: string
* Considerations: Probably not possible, but it would be amazing if you could just type in the DOI and get other things to auto-populate. Not required by PBDB.

### Publication type: 
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: 
* Info: PBDB Tips: Choose the closest possible value. “Unpublished” includes field notes, manuscripts, undergraduate theses, etc.; “guidebook” includes individual articles in guidebooks. 
* Entry type: dropdown menu. Options: journal article, book, book chapter, book/book chapter, serial monograph, compendium, Ph.D. thesis, M.S. thesis, abstract, guidebook, news article, unpublished, instcoll
* Considerations: Need to figure out what instcoll means. Also, we should talk through how this works with our private workbenches. Will it be easy to have one “Ellen’s unpublished work” that gets tagged for everything on my private workbench and then when it is time to make the collection/OTU/etc. public, I just make the new reference and replace? I think so…

## Optional fields:

### Second author: 
* PBot: 
* dwc: 
* Info:  
* Entry type: select person node- possible to start typing and then have auto-fill-in? Needs to be an easy way to accommodate adding a new person node if there is not already one created.
* Considerations: PBDB does not require for single-author papers, but does for papers with more than one author- hence this being under optional. See longer comment under Other Authors. Do we include second author as separate entity or just incorporate into “Otherauthors” comment field? 

### Other authors: 
* PBot: otherAuthors (suggested)
* dwc: 
* Info: PBDB Tips: List the third, fourth, fifth, etc. authors in order, initials first. Comma separators are optional. The word “and” before the last author is optional and not recommended. PBot may want to consider whether or not asking for first name to be spelled out is beneficial. Also, if the format used here is suitable for parsing into other formats for reports etc. 
* Entry type: string
* Considerations: This will be the fastest for data entry, and we are not looking to be able to provide complete bibliographies or to be a reference manager (e.g., find everything that Ellen Currano is an author on). First author, title, and year will be sufficient to create unique references. 

### Serial name: 
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: 
* Info: Full name of the serial (e.g., journal, edited book). PBDB Tips: none provided, but looking at download, all titles are written out in full, no abbreviations. 
* Entry type: string
* Considerations: This needs to be optional rather than required since books, guidebooks, etc. would not have anything to put here. However, it needs to be strongly recommended!

### Publication volume: 
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: 
* Info: Journal volume number
* Entry type: string
* Considerations: This is only relevant to journal articles, and should be strongly encouraged.

### Editor(s): 
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: the 
* Info: For edited books, only.
* Entry type: string
* Considerations: Rarely recorded in PBDB.

### Publisher:
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: 
* Info: Only for books: the publisher
* Entry type: string
* Considerations: Not required by PBDB

### City of publication: 
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: 
* Info: Only enter for books: the city where the book was published. 
* Entry type: string
* Considerations: Not required by PBDB

### Notes:
* PBot: TBD
* dwc: 
* Info: Place for the user to enter any additional notes they have about a reference.
* Entry type: string
* Considerations: This maps to PBDB's reference comments field.

## Fields auto-generated by PBot/PBDB:

### PBDB_Reference_no
* PBDB: Reference_no
* dwc:  NA
* Info: Internal unique identifier in the PBot database. 
* Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot when creating a new record.
* Considerations: This is used to create unique identifiers for schema, characters, and states

### –Not sure if any of these are recorded in PBot or do we pass through info and then just pull from PBDB? None of this is shown for PBDB since their user doesn’t have to enter it.–

### PBot/PBDB:ID
* PBot: pbotID:ID!
* dwc:
* Info: Internal unique identifier in the PBDB database. 
* Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBDB when creating a new record.

### PBot/PBDB: DateEntered: 
* PBot: Schema:yeardate
* dwc:
* Info: The title should be the same as the published or working title and therefore should match the reference title 
* Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot when creating a new record.

### PBot/PBDB: Entered by:  Are we using “entered by” (or some other name for it like recordedBy?)--see question from Doug’s email
* PBot: enteredBy: [SchemaEnteredBy]
* dwc: similar to but not quite synonymous with recordedBy http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/recordedBy
* Info: The user who entered the record.
* Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot when creating a new record.
