User-entry fields for each form and relevant info
(*here, a form is conceptualized as all the fields for one “submit” - probably corresponds to a node)

Structure of the info in this doc: 

Name of field for user interface: 
PBot: the PBot backend field name+code from the list Claire generated
dwc: the DarwinCore field term name and link to term info. https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/ 
Info: the definition of the field. In addition to being for our internal use, these will serve as the draft for later definitions used in the guidelines/tutorials for users. 
Entry type: describe how users will enter data into the field
Considerations: this is an optional section, if there is info to convey to the PBot team (Botany, Dev, or both) about the field. Notes, wishes, questions, etc. 

*I grouped fields by required, optional, and links to outside sources, as I found that helpful for considering the fields.

Image Nodes

Entry Fields:

Image Upload or link (How will images be handled during upload? Will it be attaching an object to a node): 
Entry type: paste link or search for file
PBot: TBD
dwc: NA
Info:  
Considerations: 

Image category*: 
Entry type: dropdown menu / checkbox: options are: holotype/exemplar, other type specimen, shows key feature, no priority. Required
PBot: TBD
dwc: NA
Info: 
Considerations: The purpose of these dropdown options are so that images can be prioritized for carousel in OTU page;.

Specimen*: 
Entry type: search for and select specimen to create relationship. Required.
PBot: Specimen::elementOf: [Specimen!]! @relation(name: “ELEMENT_OF”, direction: OUT)
dwc: NOT materialSampleID, this is only used for the material specimen not digital versions of the specimen
Info: User able to assign to multiple specimens (potentially multiple specimens in single photo, ex. multiple leaves, leaf and cuticle, etc.
Considerations: What if multiple groups enter same images, but don’t realize it because they haven’t made them public? Later for more discussion generally. There needs to be a check in place to make sure that a similar node hasn’t already been created every time someon hits “Publish” or “Make Public” Duplicates would be flagged (at image or specimen level?)

Group*: 
Entry type: select public and/or groups to create relationship. Required.
PBot: Group:elementOf: [Group!]! @relation(name: “ELEMENT_OF”, direction: OUT)
dwc: NA
Info: User able to assign multiple groups including “Public”
Considerations: Will this image be included in public domain or does group want to restrict it?

?Image filename*: 
Entry type: string
PBot: TBD
dwc: NA
Info: The filename likely needs to be assigned by PBot or user gets to provide some information that is used in filename? That would mean additional fields. Andrew has made comments about how this should be handled in the past. 
Considerations: 

Image Acknowledgements*: 
Entry type: string. Required.
PBot: TBD
dwc: NA
Info: A space for enterers to acknowledge photographers, sources, museums, etc.
Considerations: Enterer must take responsibility to ensure that copyright of image is satisfied. Should this be required or is there another way around this?

Image Caption*: 
Entry type: string. Required.
PBot: TBD
dwc: NA
Info: A descriptive caption for the image or plate
Considerations: Minimum information will be suggested in training materials



Fields auto-generated by PBot:

pbotID
PBot: pbotID:ID!
dwc:  NA
Info: Internal unique identifier in the PBot database. 
Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot when creating a new record.
Considerations: 

Date Created: 
PBot: Schema:yeardate
dwc: NA

Entry type: string
Considerations: Be sure to resolve conflict with enteredBy: [SchemaEnteredBy] already in PBot. No entry, is autogenerated by PBot based on the user login when creating a new record.

Entered by:  Are we using “entered by” (or some other name for it like recordedBy?)--see question from Doug’s email
PBot: enteredBy: [SchemaEnteredBy]
dwc: similar to but not quite synonymous with recordedBy http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/recordedBy
Info: The user who entered the record.
Entry type: no entry, is autogenerated by PBot when creating a new record.
Considerations:
