# What is PBot?
The Integrative Paleobotany Portal (PBot) is a free online software for fossil plant data management, analysis, and exploration. Core to the PBot mission is providing broad access to paleobotanical research tools and data and to provide an efficient pipeline for data entry that ensures that research products and data are freely available to the general public for the long term. 

The **PBot Explore** portal allows anyone to browse and view all public fossil plant data that has been entered into PBot. Some of the most notable data includes fossil specimens and species (or taxa), their descriptions and images, and the location of fossils in time and space.

For registered users, the **PBot Workbench** allows users to (1) create novel, dynamic character schemas for describing plant fossils; (2) enter and compare descriptions of specimens for informally and formally named plant taxa; and (3) comment on PBot contents via a community forum to stimulate productive scientific discourse. Data can be entered as private or public, allowing PBot to be used from the start to the finish of a project. All public data can be accessed by anyone using PBotâ€™s Explore feature. 

PBot works with and complements existing databases (iDigBio, the Paleobiology Database, Plant Fossil Names) to enhance utility and accessibility of paleobotanical data, allowing paleobotanists to more easily fulfill NSF (or other funding agency) data management plans.
