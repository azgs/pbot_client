Following the Paleobiology Database Guidelines, we recommend that you also cite or acknowledge those who contributed and entered the bulk of the data that you are using in analyses. Create a secondary data bibliography for work that uses large data sets, which can be included as a supplementary material file in manuscript submissions. This helps ensure that the hard work of collecting and describing fossil plants gets acknowledged.
