#Quantitative Traits for Vegetative Material
*1. Leaf Mass per Area* 
- Definition: The leaf dry-mass investment per unit of light-intercepting leaf area deployed. 
- Measurement: For modern specimens, divide leaf dry mass by leaf area. For fossils, measure petiole width and leaf area and use the calibration model of Royer et al. 2007.

*2. Stomatal Density*
- Definition: number of stomata per leaf area

*3. Stomatal Index*
- Definition: the proportion of stomata relative to total epidermal cell number. (stomatal density) / (stomatal density + epidermal cell density) x 100%. Alternately, (# stomata) / (# stomata + # epidermal cells) x 100

*4. Insect Herbivore Damage*
- Definition: Plant organ was damaged while alive, and damage scars are most likely to have been made by insect herbivores.
- Measurement:
    a. Presence / Absence
    b. Functional feeding group present: hole feeding, margin feeding, skeletonization, surface feeding, mining, galling, piercing & sucking, oviposition, boring, fungal & pathogen
    c. Damage types present, following Labandeira et al.'s Damage Guide
    
*5. Leaf vein density*
- Definition: vein length per unit leaf area

*6. Leaf size*
- Leaf area
- Leaf length
- Leaf width

*7. Digital Leaf Physiognomy Variables*
- Shape factor: 4(pi)(leaf area / leaf perimeter squared)
- Feret-diameter ratio: feret diameter / major axis length
- Tooth-area ratio: area of all teeth / leaf area
- Tooth count: total number of teeth
- Standardized tooth count: tooth count / leaf perimeter
- Internal perimeter: leaf perimeter after teeth are removed
- Blade perimeter: leaf perimeter
