Forms:

Homepage: inlcuding logos, sleek images, and portals to the following informational pages and the thre primary portals:
  -About page (project overview, project personnell, funding sources, how to cite, metrics of use (some summary metrics could also populate to homepage) 
  -How-To page (where tutorials live, in multiple formats and languages)
  -Registration page
  -log-on (only necessary for entering data, could be on portal II instead)
  -(I) Database search portal (explore)
  -(II) Data Entry portal (takes to login and researcher's "workbench")
  -(III) Education portal (all outreach and educational content)


I. Database search portal
  -simple and advanced query options
  -search within PBot or link(?) search to PBDB (for example, for mapping purposes)
  -output data formats, has options online and downloads. Customize download fields (e.g., which characters)
  

II. Data Entry Portal ("The Workbench")
  (once logged-in, the workbench home page reflects summary data from your entries? or customized to show your most recent entries, or something like that?) 
 Functions/portals to new pages:
 II.A. Enter new taxon record (takes you through a series of pages for data entry). Have option to make public/private.
    1. New Morphype/species -or- Propose new occurrence of existing taxon. 
    2. Exemplar Specimen(s)
      -link to iDigBio or existing record to pull specimen metadata (i.e. geology) and images
      -not avail on iDigBio: enter the data manually - use all needed Darwincore fields for occcurrence records, repository, specimen(s)
    3. Customize entry options - choose your schemas. 
      -preservation type
      -broad group/clade
      -(have the above result in a suggestion of applicable schemas? or just show all possibilities?)
      -select (like checking boxes) character schema(s) to apply (can hover, or "view schema" during the selection process), includes trait data selections      
    4. Data entry (enter states for the characters of selected schema) - this may be just one html entry page that you scroll till finished or multiple pages (one per schema?) that you enter data into - not sure what is easier developement-wise
    5. Diagnosis (how to structure?). Characteristics differentiating from similar taxa. 
    6. Notes on taxon
    7. Some assessment of 
    
    The taxon page: An entered taxon page would include:
      "static info" reflecting what was entered: informal/formal name. Author info. Specimen data (museum record, geographic and temporal info, preservation). Images (possible as a viewer, or just link to images - the first option significantly better). Character+state (only the entered data, nothing that was left blank); trait data (linked data files if applicable, such .csv files stored in any repository -could have measurements, or census data, etc). The diagnosis and characters differentiating from similar taxa. Systematic info as far as is known (mirror DarwinCore fields)
       
       Button/fields for further functions for the taxon:  Add comment to the forum (at bottom of page), Add new occurrences, Add new characters/states, Propose affinity, Propose synonomy 
 
 
 II.B Comment on records (discussion forum) 
      -search for and pull up record(s)
      -add forum comment to taxon record
 
      
 II.C. Enter new schema (this could just, or also, be an option under II.A.3, so it is streamlined if you are mid-entry)
      -(1) New schema (set of characters) vs. (2) add states to existing character vs. (3) add characters to existing schema
      -options for adding state selections (i.e., multiple choice) and free-text states and combo of the two (e.g., state A, state B, state C, state other:____)
      -enter name for character set, propose taxonomic group that it is applicable for 


III. Education Portal
-possibly subdivide by education level: general, K-5, 6-9, 10-12, college, etc.)
-place for lesson plans and/or project ideas for educators to be available
-any community-data entry project outlines/instructions/etc. 
-glossary of terms (this will be linked from the data entry portal too, but there should be a master list of definitions here)
-education discussion forum


Potential separate portal: 
IV: Discussion Forum
-In general I think that comments related to specific taxa, or characters, etc, should be attached to that info (such as a comment section at the bottom of every page that displays commentary on whatever data is on the page). For example, if you have a certain morphotype's page pulled up, any comments about that taxon should be displayed at the bottom of the page. 
-However, it could be useful if there is somewhere for more generalized discussion, and to have a way to look at "recent forum activity" so that new comments or propositions are collected to a general place that allows moderators or clean-up crew or anyone interested to go view, and weigh-in on, the activity. I'm envisioning a master list of recent activity with the ability to link to the relevant page (taxon or character, whatever). 
  
  


*Questions:
1) browsing your own entries (dataset)- is this all done through the main search functions (i.e., you restrict the search to your locality, or by enterer) 
2) somewhere should the schemas be available to explore without it being within the "enter data" portals
3) formal functions for things like: proposing a synonomy, proposing systematic affinity, proposing new occurrence of a taxon(?)
