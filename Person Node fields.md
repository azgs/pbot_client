# User-entry fields for Person Nodes

## Structure of the info in this doc:
Because thinking through Person Nodes also required us to think through User Registration information, this document includes sections for each of these.

Fields are divided into *Required Fields*, which users must enter when they create the node, Recommended Fields, which are encouraged to be entered on node creation but not required (note, none exist for Groups), and Fields that will be autogenerated by PBot, which should be viewable by users. For each field, we have compiled the information and structured as follows:
 
### Name of field for user interface: 
* PBot: the PBot backend field name+code from the list Claire generated. Many will be missing.
* dwc: the DarwinCore field term name and link to term info. https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/ 
* Info: the definition of the field. In addition to being for our internal use, these will serve as the draft for later definitions used in the guidelines/tutorials for users. 
* Entry type: describe how users will enter data into the field
* Considerations: this is an optional section, if there is info to convey to the PBot team (Botany, Dev, or both) about the field. Notes, wishes, questions, etc.
